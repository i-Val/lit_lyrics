Amazing grace (how sweet the sound) 
that saved a wretch like me! 
I once was lost, but now am found, 
was blind, but now I see. 


 
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, 
and grace my fears relieved; 
how precious did that grace appear 
the hour I first believed! 


 
Through many dangers, toils and snares 
I have already come: 
'tis grace has brought me safe thus far, 
and grace will lead me home. 


 
The Lord has promised good to me, 
his word my hope secures; 
he will my shield and portion be 
as long as life endures. 


 
Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail, 
and mortal life shall cease: 
I shall possess, within the veil, 
a life of joy and peace. 


 
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, 
the sun forbear to shine; 
but God, who called me here below, 
will be forever mine.
